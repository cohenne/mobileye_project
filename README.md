Detecting traffic lights and the distance to them on runtime within given video using image processing and machine learning.

### 1. Traffic Lights Attention
Detection of source lights in an image using convolution with customized high- and low-pass filters. 

### 2. Traffic Lights Detection
Generating and training CNN using the products of the previous stage as input, to conclude all the traffic lights in the image (using tensorflow). 

### 3. Distance Estimation
Estimating the distance to each detected traffic light from the camera picturing the images of interest, involving geometric and linear algebra calculations. 

### 4. Integration
Integrating all previous parts into a functional and intuitive SW product.
